DOP trees can generate trees and subtrees, we can use (sub-)trees as features and apply a learning algorithm to predict the politeness of an sentence.

For instance, we can split the data into neutral, polite and impolite, then for each set we can determine the probability of a certain subtree.
With these probabilities we can estimate whether a sentence is polite, but also what part of the sentence structure makes it so.
