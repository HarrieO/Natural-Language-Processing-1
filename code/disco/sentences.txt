<s>I'm running out of ideas of useful edits to do.</s>
<s>Have you got any ideas?</s>
<s>SuaveArt has edited his post on the Wikipedia Review and is now lying about me.</s>
<s>Did you see the actual post there before he changed it so you can back up my cut-n-paste of what it said?</s>
<s>I'm sure that this is not a useful place to discuss the merits of your topic ban, which I think would need a wider audience to overturn.</s>
<s>Perhaps you could make a request to the arbitration committee?</s>
<s>So both of us already broke 3RR.</s>
<s>Do you want to esclate it?</s>
<s>Naughty naughty!</s>
<s>:-) How goes things?</s>
<s>I see your nomination of Template:GR today, and I'd ask you to look at my proposal.</s>
<s>If you like it, would you be willing to find someone with the technical knowhow to try it out?</s>
<s>Doing it under the guidance of the relevant <url> would be a good idea as the folks that are active in the project will be best placed to advise on which templates and styles fit in with the rest of the project.</s>

<s>Who is this Brit you keep talking about?</s>
<s>A past vandal or something?</s>
<s>Over at <url> you've changed my request for protection on <url> to a request for unprotection.</s>

<s>I actually know nothing about karate, but you look to be doing a good job with your work, and I'm just here to say sorry really that some of your articles got deleted.</s>
<s>Which artiles got deleted?</s>
<s>Perhaps these articles should be nominated for deletion.</s>
<s>A blue belt is far from a notable BJJ player; Google returns 594 results for him, many of which might not even be the Barry Ley in question; and as for the Blaggers article: I don't see any articles on the higher-selling books you mention, why does this one deserve it?</s>
<s>See the page <url>, and in particular the section <url>.</s>
<s>Does that make sense?</s>
<s>It's not Bowdlerism to delete nonsensical trivia about which movies an actress appears nude in.</s>
<s>Should we indicate what color her hair is in those movies?</s>
<s>The discussion about Durant has been closed in mediation and will presumably soon be archived.</s>
<s>How do you want to handle his removal as a source in the article?</s>
<s>I'm sure you're right but I can't find it in FM and haven't found it anywhere else.</s>
<s>Could you cite sources in the article?</s>
<s>Hi, You stated the editor is inactive, yet the editor is stalking me through MY CONTRIBUTIONS and reverting my entries and the editor left a message on the top of my TALK page, so why would you not block them ?</s>

<s>As I note on the [[Wikipedia talk:Piped link|talk page]], "[s]ee [[Lindsay Lohan]] for a good example of why piping is a good thing (a simple [&#91;2003 in film]] in line would create clunky, hard-to-follow writing&mdash;better to use no links at all).</s>

<s>Just a question about the maintenance categories that FemtoBot automatically creates each month: I've noticed that the bot is frequently forced to recreate old, long-deleted monthly categories in the <person> queue, because an article got reverted to an old version for one reason or another and resulted in the old category being temporarily repopulated again.</s>
<s>I'm just putting this forward as an idea for discussion, and am certainly not wedded to it u2014 but just to keep things simpler for everyone, I wonder what you would think about the feasibility and/or desirability of recoding the bot so that when it encounters a repopulated old maintenance category, it would retag the article to the ''current'' month instead of recreating the old one?</s>

<s>On another note, I'm going to assume that you were the one who also added ridership data for various LIRR stations, am I correct?</s>
<s>If so, could you kindly point me towards your source?</s>
<s>One the the main reasons I ask for a citation is to learn precisely what is meant by "the consistency of the reals".</s>
<s>You haven't heard anything about this, Trovatore, have you?</s>
<s>I advance (Ultra-Orthodox) Rabbi Dr Mordechai Halperin, (Ultra-Orthodox), Rabbi Gershon Winkler, (Conservative) Rabbi Elliot Dorff, to you, for example, that the Torah and Talmud only forbids anal sex.</s>
<s>Now explain exactly what division of Judaism is left, for you to claim your view fairly represents?</s>
<s>Sure AGK.</s>
<s>Does the draft need to be updated to include the tweaks?</s>
<s>Okay Murgh, I userfied only your revisions of Sore Thumbs to your user space, <url>.</s>
<s>Did you want the associated talk page or can I delete that?</s>
<s>Are the remaining IPs on <url> still a problem?</s>
<s>If so is Tom dealing with it?</s>
<s>Could you kindly stick to the issue at hand in the FAC?</s>
<s>Which is to discuss the article, not me?</s>
<s>Instead of deletion, I'm considering simply redirecting Ponystars to <url>.</s>
<s>Any objections?</s>
<s>Later the same can be done for the other sports.</s>
<s>What do you say?</s>
<s>Hi Awadewit,  I hope I've started a discussion at <url>?</s>
<s>Would you like to weigh in there?</s>
<s>Is there any kind of system for working on things?</s>
<s>I mean, if you've taken something on, are you supposed to just do it and say so after the fact or are you supposed to mention it on the WikiProject Germany page?</s>
<s>I downloaded VandalProof, but it says that I'm not on the user list.</s>
<s>How do I get on the user list?</s>
<s>Oh dear.</s>
<s>Does that mean it's too difficult a read for Wiki?</s>
<s><url> as having been deleted via a deletion discussion, however I can't find any such Afd.</s>
<s>Do you know of one?</s>
<s>Yesterday you undid an edit of mine (on the <url> article).</s>
<s>What did you mean by "a COI link"?</s>
<s>It appears the question posted to your comment <url> was not answered.</s>
<s>Out of curiosity, where is the correct place?</s>
<s>Thanks.</s>
<s>As for the previous edits, should I make a note on the User Page that it's my account?</s>
<s>Just had a look at <url>, and oh dear god.</s>
<s>Any interest?</s>
<s>In my calculation if I got blocked that would only be good for me as it would clear my mind from the obsession to try and change that which seems wrong and mutable, but carries no private benefits for the reformer.</s>
<s>Is that line of thinking truly alien to you?</s>
<s>I have it now; it lists 22 Members, seven officers and a large number of sons of Members.</s>
<s>Do you think we could run to a new article, say <url>?</s>
<s>Those of us who've been here the whole time are pretty incredulous about it also.</s>
<s>:)  We miss your fine editing style and hope you come back sometime -- keep looking in on us now and then, at least?</s>
<s>Sorry, what?</s>
<s>Could you be more specific please?</s>
<s>Thanks.</s>
<s>Can you use <url>?</s>
<s>I am not familiar with the credit card / porn star identity incident you mentioned in AnonEMouse's RFA, but I would like to take a closer look at it.</s>
<s>Could you provide some more direct diffs related to Mouse's involvment?</s>
<s>Is the bot correct and if so can I assume that is the standard to follow ?</s>
<s>?</s>
<s>Yes, I'd say split it.</s>
<s>But, where's the controversial opinion?</s>
<s>It's not too late to help at all - being busy has kept the work on it to a crawl.</s>
<s>;)  I'd like to represent what you are referring to; was it on the Abom talk page or somewhere else?</s>
<s>My contribution tried to show the impression to others I'am only trying to improve spelling.</s>
<s>What's the difference between personel and persona?</s>
<s>Started, shall we post on the <url> page and ask for others to collaborate.</s>
<s>Is that a good use of the WikiProject?</s>
<s>That might be very helpful.</s>
<s>How can I get it?</s>
<s>Also, u201ccould be expectedu201d?</s>
<s>By whom?</s>
<s>Well, we can certainly sort out those kinds of issues once the task force has formed.</s>
<s>Have you sought or found support through WPMILHIST yet?</s>
<s>Seems to be down again.</s>
<s>I assume this is nothing I can resurrect on my own when you have intermittent Internet access like this?</s>
<s>Thanks for that - very nicely commented code (rare to see)!</s>
<s>It seems to need a table to be set up - do you have the schema or sql for that handy?</s>
<s>kindly explain why did you remove my changes.</s>
<s>The added links were quite relevant and informational, also The Vanguard Group and Hi5, why do you revert my edits?</s>
<s>I am sorry, got confused on who created this article.</s>
<s>:-/ Apologies?</s>
<s>I clean up the <url> article a bit.</s>
<s>What do you think?</s>
<s>Fatwa?</s>
<s>What is that?</s>
<s>I'm not sure what you mean by the old factory farming discussion.</s>
<s>Is something missing?</s>
<s>I'm trying to install Lupin/Anti-vandal tool, but im stuck.</s>
<s>Could you help please?</s>
<s>Oh, it's not that big of a deal.</s>
<s>Drew, which IP edit did you consider to be "attacking"?</s>
<s>I have never seen anything which says that warning levels should begin anew each day.</s>
<s><url> says that warning templates "are listed at right in order of severity, but need not be used in succession.</s>
<s>" If there is another policy somewhere, could you show it to me?</s>
<s>No, I don't know of any way to measure the number of visitors to articles.</s>
<s>Perhaps someone on the <url> can answer your question?</s>
<s>It's not a ban, it's an indefinite block.</s>
<s>He'll know about it when he tries to edit and he'll know that it was me that blocked him, so what's the pint of telling him again on his talk page?</s>
<s>So you are still sidestepping the question.</s>
<s>Please answer it directly:  please answer my question, clearly:  are you saying is that you cannot use the wiki to edit cooperatively with other people on the same text, or are you saying that you can use the wiki as it was intended and edit a single text cooperatively?</s>
<s>How do you fix all those edits at once?</s>
<s>Do you have to be an admin to do so?</s>
<s>Hi.</s>
<s>Why did you blank the redirect at <url>?</s>
<s>Hi, that "Multics Virtual Memory: Concepts and Design" paper is already in the list of Multics papers (in the "Further Reading - Technical Details) - it even has the same URL!</s>
<s>It only lists one source, though - perhaps the second could be added as an "(also here)" link?</s>
<s>I noticed you've been adding the template <person> to pages - I'm sure there's a good reason but I'm totally puzzled as to why.</s>
<s>Can you explain what it does?</s>
<s>What are you looking for regarding reliable sources?</s>
<s>Of the above statements, what needs to be sourced outside of the manga itself?</s>
<s>I have no need to search the interwebs, all that matters is it offends people and is a violation of NPOV and MoS.</s>
<s>"All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views (that have been published by reliable sources)" - ess-eff is a bias term for a minority group of fans, put it this way: is there an SF-channel, or how often is the clichxe9 ess-eff used outside fan-groups?</s>
<s>Third: it's August 31 2010.</s>
<s>Please check my userpage for reasons why I really don't feel useful today.</s>
<s>Ask another admin, okay?</s>
<s>Dana, before I give the examples of what sections or parts in the article that needs fixing, I need to know if <url> is still gonna work on the problems.</s>
<s>Do you get me?</s>
<s>Making edits vanish without a trace would be ''extremely'' difficult to do u2013 only full <url> could do that, and I can assure you the oversighters wouldn't do such a thing just to allow somebody to cover their tracks.</s>
<s>Maybe you are mis-remembering something, about edits that were in fact on some other page?</s>
<s>I assume you like to play '''U.</s>
<s>S.</s>
<s>''' billiards bottom right corner?</s>
<s>I have a question.</s>
<s>How do I move these pictures you talked about, to Wikimedia Commons?</s>
<s>"a wikipedia addict.</s>

<s>" -- Who, '''''me'''''?</s>
<s>!</s>
<s>?</s>
<s>Can you expand <url>?</s>
<s>From what I gather the Dorje Ling nunnery is part of the monastery complex?</s>
<s>I think these are reasonable, and should protect you from lawyering.</s>
<s>Should I go ahead and add this?</s>
<s>Where did you learn English?</s>
<s>How come you're taking on a third language?</s>
<s>I see you deleted the Shayla LaVeaux article, citing copyright problems.</s>
<s>I'd like to see if I can't clean it up.</s>
<s>.</s>
<s>.</s>
<s>is there any way I can see the deleted article?</s>
<s>Sorry, I've moved a number of articles and thought I did it correctly.</s>
<s>How is moving done properly without losing the edit history?</s>
<s>So, basically, you're just violating <url> and <url>.</s>
<s>Why?</s>
<s>Just reminder, but you tagged <url> with the GAreview tag several days ago.</s>
<s>Have you completed your review comments yet?</s>
<s>You do not appear to have alerted the other previous Delete advocates yet.</s>
<s>May we take this as a tacit admission that actually you ''were'' intending to skew the deletion review?</s>
<s>Sorry for the slow reply, something I needed to take care of.</s>
<s><url> is restored- if it is mentioned in such <url>, could you please <url> them in the article?</s>
<s>And NO Igor, discuss edits with ME please.</s>
<s>Are you proposing to discard the mentorship agreement?</s>
<s><url> is fooling around with the Rubinstein and Horowitz articles again.</s>
<s>Is there a way to get him banned?</s>
<s>Why, precisely?</s>
<s>And what separates the etiquette of your area of society from our "conventional etiquette" speed-developed on the Internet?</s>
<s>Hi, what are the technical steps to withdraw a nomination to delete a category?</s>
<s>Or more specifically, what template did you use to withdraw your nomination?</s>
<s>Do you have a link for that?</s>
<s>I assume you mean you're out <url>?</s>
<s>Hey, if you want to assert that a cite does not say what it clearly does say, how about actually coming to the discussion page to discuss it, rather than treating edit summaries like a discussion space?</s>
<s>Why the hell am I the one being accused of edit warring, when I'm the only one actually willing to talk on the discussion page?</s>
<s>Glad to see someone else involved.</s>
<s>I've suggested an RfC, what do you think?</s>
<s>Thank you for the rollback.</s>
<s>Does it appear in <url> or only in the history?</s>
<s>May I suggest you actually read the article before claiming it not to be nonsense and removing my CSD tag?</s>
<s>Are you an admin?</s>
<s>eh, i've ALWAYS hated 50 meter pools (200 butterfly was always the BIGGEST pain in the ass) although i really did like butterfly for some reason.</s>
<s>.</s>

<s>never quite got that, so was it an indoor or outdoor pool?</s>
<s>?</s>
<s>?</s>
<s>?</s>
<s>I vote that they stay, given that even though they're not "Recurring" in and of themselves, they're part of a recurring phenomenon, which is Stephen doing "Better Know a District" spin-offs.</s>
<s>So, maybe we should re-group them under a heading of "Spin-Offs" in the "BKaD" section?</s>
<s>He's taken the notice down.</s>
<s>Doesn't this count as belaboring the point?</s>
<s><url>.</s>
<s>Draft beer?</s>
<s>Why are you uploading/changing badge files here?</s>
<s>Surely you should just upload them to Commons then list the wikipedia version for deletion?</s>
<s>Respectfully, you've replied to the message below mine a day ago now.</s>
<s>Could you provide guidance for my request please?</s>
<s>oh, my, how did I get this here twice; trying to do too much at once (what else is new).</s>
<s>Can you copy instead a different color?</s>
<s>Thank you for deleting the attack page I tagged.</s>
<s>Should <url> be blocked for creating it?</s>
<s>I was wondering, why did you do that, create that new cat and then add it to the polanski without any discussion at all?</s>
<s>Have you read the polanski talkpage and seen the lengthy discussion regarding the cats there?</s>
<s><url>.</s>
<s>So, when people click <url>, where do they expect to be taken?</s>
<s>You speedily deleted a JPatrickBedell redirect with R3, but there's a number of reliable sources that mention it.</s>
<s>Can I repost the redirect, or if controversial, where would the discussion be?</s>
<s>If you're talking about the Recycling Troll, I've never blocked him.</s>
<s>Why do you think I have?</s>
<s>Well, as you Matt57, my standards for OR a bit strict, as the recent discussion on the policy's talk page shows.</s>
<s>Secondly, do you not find it interesting that Arrow only removes Muhammad (who is sourced), but does not remove Archimedes who is unsourced?</s>
<s>I see a "remove protection" tab on the <url>, which tells an admin that the article is protected.</s>
<s>Are you still able to edit it?</s>
<s>Hell yeah.</s>
<s>How do we do that?</s>
<s>Thanks for additional info about Marcinkus.</s>
<s>Do you think the article is close to the <url>?</s>
<s>Congratulations!</s>
<s>You are the winner of <url> Round 10.</s>
<s>Would you like to prepare the questions for the next Wikifun?</s>
<s>Sounds interesting.</s>
<s>Could people keep me in the loop as well?</s>
<s>Hello, again.</s>
<s>Would you care to intervene at <url>?</s>
<s>Unfortunately I think <url> may also add that material; I am not familiar with Citizendum, though, but I will look at it.</s>
<s>If Citizendum has the same policies regarding primary, secondary, and tertiary sources, then why not criticize both Wikipedia and Citizendum?</s>
<s>I can't find it.</s>
<s>Maybe I didn't manage to guess the right name; can you find it in your contribs?</s>
<s>I'm responding here in an effort to keep the conversation in one place and would appreciate it if you would do the same.</s>
<s>Did you see where I said above that images which only allow non-commercial use are still considered to be non-free?</s>
<s>No worries.</s>
<s>Can you take another look at the nom?</s>
<s>I suggest we start with the History section.</s>
<s>What do you think?</s>
<s>Wow that's old!</s>
<s>What do you think of <url>?</s>
<s>I did a CC sharealike 2.</s>
<s>0.</s>
<s>How is that different from 1.</s>
<s>0?</s>
<s>I just reverted your addition of a fossil range template to <url>, because with only an arrow at the very right it didn't seem to add much useful information.</s>
<s>Perhaps we could make a separate template to show only the Cenozoic or so, which would allow us to show more detail in these fossil ranges?</s>
<s>I wasn't aware my statement was supposed to cause worry.</s>
<s>Is there something I'm missing?</s>
<s>Thanks for your edits to the LEMS article a couple of days back.</s>
<s>Any hope of you reviewing it for GAC?</s>
<s>Before I prod this article.</s>
<s>Do you want to save it by adding some independent citations to it to say why it's important independently of UNE?</s>
<s>Thank you for taking the time to review my nomination of <url> as a featured article candidate.</s>

<s>Mattisse hun, you haven't been on wiki for a couple of weeks.</s>
<s>Are you ok?</s>
<s>He's back <url>, <url> as <url>.</s>
<s>Also, in the future would you rather me just post these to <url>, or do you just want to continue handeling him?</s>
<s>Hey, I saw you edited the Dark Tower Series page.</s>
<s>I was just wondering if you were a fan of the series?</s>
<s>Ok, I'd agree about <url> being better.</s>
<s>Should I delete the other one (you could also tag it for speedy deletion as a mistake)?</s>
<s>OK then.</s>
<s>What's your problem with putting this in the lead : "is one of the <url> counties of the <url> and " ?</s>
<s>The quote about the ship "being fit for nothing but the scrap yard" does not appear on pages 26-27.</s>
<s>Does it appear elsewhere in the book?</s>
<s>Thanks for the articles on South African cricket teams - I was planning to do them myself but I really appreciate that you've done them.</s>
<s>By the way, where did you find the information on what regions the teams represent?</s>
<s>As far as I can tell, the personal attacks against editors has indeed subsided.</s>
<s>Are you indicating you are aware of recent incidents?</s>
<s>You were right that there was a problem, but I see Xn4 has now had a go at it.</s>
<s>Perhaps you could look at it again?</s>
<s>?</s>
<s>What?</s>
<s>Personal attacks and refusing to answer questions.</s>
<s>What are you hiding?</s>
<s>I'm pretty sure I didn't violate 3RR unless there's another revert I'm missing.</s>
<s>Does replacing the "/" in <tt>&lt;ref name=missingref /></tt> when replacing a deleted reference count as a revert?</s>
<s>Sure.</s>
<s>Aside from the Flea and Frusciante articles, which get the most traffic?</s>
<s>I also have problems with a lot of the other recategorisation you have done to these articles, but I won't revert any more until I hear from you.</s>
<s>Taking <url> as an example: why have you removed it from <url> when it clearly is a linear filter; why remove it from <url> when it forms part of image parameter theory; why does an article which discusses electronic designs not belong in <url>; why remove it from <url> when, obviously, it is a term?</s>
<s>Hi Deb, I created the page which was deleted which I hoped could have been a stub starting point for building up a better and more detailed article about the organisation.</s>
<s>Could you offer some advice on how I could have made it better and have avoided deletion?</s>
<s>I don't understand how you find it appropriate to talk about your illegal drug use on your user page.</s>
<s>Also, how do you have the right to ban other people's usernames with a name like "'''BONG'''warrior"?</s>
<s>BTW, I see you've left some comments at <url>.</s>
<s>Would you be interested in signing on to the project?</s>
<s>''Don't'' talk ''about'' me, in my virtual presence, and tell someone else to ignore me.</s>

<s>Surely this counts as being featured on the single?</s>
<s>Apologies again, though.</s>
<s>If I tell a fart joke, will you forgive me?</s>
<s>I'm familiar with <url> and I don't think it violates <url>.</s>
<s>Which specific provision of <url> are you referring to?</s>
<s>Thanks for pointing that out.</s>
<s>Do you suppose we should move or copy these image requests to the MilHist task forces too?</s>
<s><person>, whom you blocked for 3RR, is contesting their block with what appear to be defensible arguments.</s>
<s>Would you like to comment?</s>
<s>Hi SE7 - There's some vandalism coming from your account, see <url>.</s>
<s>As your past history doesn't seem to fit with this, has someoen either hacked your account or a logged-in session?</s>
<s>Oh that's charming, so instead of making a personal attack on a single editor you made it on a class of editors.</s>
<s>Does that somehow make it more ok?</s>
<s>The animal has only just been discovered by western science: I've seen no claim of any photograph having been taken.</s>
<s>I have no idea of how to research/decide open the status of the computer gererated graphic that has been on many press reports: can you?</s>
<s>I moved '''Engine Arm Aqueduct''' to <url>, because there seemed to be much more content about the canal than the actual <url>.</s>
<s>Does that seem reasonable, to you?</s>
<s>I thought that it seemed a bit removed from Imlay's own time and there was no real explanation of the significance of Imlay to Twain (if any) or of Imlay's reputation between her death and the end of the nineteenth century or in America.</s>
<s>What do you think?</s>
<s>Hi- The Magnificent Clean-keeper- I note that you recently removed a contribution I made to the <url> page, citing lack of "notability" as the reason.</s>
<s>Iu2019m not saying you where wrong to do so (notability is an important criteria in the Wiki project), however, since the definition of "notability" is hard to pin down, could we discuss this particular instance, in greater detail, at some point?</s>
<s>Sorry, but the Find feature tells me that "Heavydata" isn't anywhere on the ANI page.</s>
<s>Did you mean to send me somewhere else?</s>
<s>It's cool (<url>), but the high resolution vs.</s>

<s>Hmm why?</s>
<s>Actually, that's again a misromanization.</s>
<s>Would you ''please'' stop this insanity?</s>
<s>I have a question for you.</s>
<s>How do you deal with an editor, who's soul mission is to undo ALL <url> across a vast number of articles?</s>
<s>Thank you for your Wikignome-like edits.</s>
<s>What do you think, substantively?</s>
<s>Hi, I have opened a discussion at <url>.</s>
<s>Perhaps you would like to contribute?</s>
<s>What do you mean by "one edit war away"?</s>
<s>And whats a siteban?</s>
<s>Hi.</s>
<s>The font-size for the links in this template may be on the small side, but it seems to be floating okay -- or do I need to check more places where it's used?</s>
<s>Hey, I see you've been contributing!</s>
<s>Time to lose the "leaving Wikipedia" box?</s>
<s>I see you don't edit the heats from morning session.</s>
<s>Will you be here for the finals ?</s>
<s>Hi, I can run a newsletter bot for you, WesleyDodds.</s>
<s>Whatcha need me to deliver?</s>
<s>That sounds fine, but why would you want somebody who knows nothing about the show to write them?</s>
<s>If you are informed about it, wouldn't you be a good person to do it?</s>
<s>#On the other hand, linking years of actual encyclopedic events to "1949 in NASCAR" or "1950 in motor racing" <s>gives us a tool for eventually building those year-in-topic articles</s> automatically builds those categories.</s>
<s>Where some don't exist yet (like 1949 in both NASCAR and motor racing), are we better off adding the desired link and letting it be redlinked until the article is created, or just leaving it unlinked or wikilinked to the general year article such as <url>?</s>
<s>I would be willing to move this article to the incubator so that it can be worked on (I agree it wouldn't be an A7 today), though if it's to be made into a real article it needs to be done with someone with no conflict of interest regarding the subject, as creating articles for things you own is highly discouraged.</s>
<s>If I undelete it to the incubator would you agree to let it go and leave it up to other users without a conflict of interest?</s>
<s>What do you suggest we do?</s>
<s>Since it looks like Gaddafi may retake Ras Lanuf in a day or so and there has been fighting there for the last four days, should we create an article named Second battle of Ras Lanuf or should we reopen the old one and say when the rebels took it it was phase one and now, two days later, it's phase two?</s>
<s><person> I find this conversation remarkable given that you have twice opted to edit war over referencing format to the detriment of an article's quality in the last 24 hours on <url>.</s>

<s>Yes, I do have the Family Guy DVD collection, Volume 1, Seasons 1&2.</s>

<s>Hi.</s>
<s>Would you be interested in reviewing <url> for its GA nomination?</s>
<s>I plan on getting the page up at some point this weekend, no latter than Monday though for obvious reasons.</s>
<s>Why do you ask?</s>
<s>Interrobang has asked me if I would also help mentor you when he is not around.</s>
<s>I said that I would gladly help out if it was ok with you?</s>
<s>So your argument is that as long as you follow the "rules," nothing else should matter?</s>
<s>That if it's legal it's OK?</s>
<s>While half-inching a citation from <url> to use elsewhere, I was reminded what a good article it is.</s>
<s>Are you planning to take it to FAC at any point?</s>
<s>I gave user <url> an official 3RR.</s>

<s>Is one or the other correct, or does it depend on the original language - for instance Italian vs.</s>
<s>German?</s>
<s>It looks like the current version of <url> has been reworked since when you built it in July 2005 and references have never been provided.</s>
<s>Do you have any references you can add to the article?</s>
<s>In any case <url> should have just been me saying "hey, could use some help" and maybe one or two short replies of "sounds good, I'll help" or "make sure you do XYZ", but instead TT2011 again tried to turn it into another discussion.</s>
<s>Can we collapse it to save bulk?</s>
<s>I hope Ed's doesn't look like mine.</s>
<s>Wait--what is this navbar we're talking about?</s>
<s>That reference was not inserted by Yahoo.</s>
<s>Which main page did you mean?</s>
<s>Hi, somebody added this <url> to the <url> article.</s>
<s>Is it appropriate?</s>

<s>Darkstar, I am completely baffled by this, I don't know where you are coming from or what your complaint is, and you are one of the writers that I most often agree with.</s>
<s>Can you explain?</s>

<s>On <url> there's a comment by you about moving the page to its official name.</s>
<s>Any more thoughts on that?</s>
<s>Thank you for that, I was having a problem with diffs and the explanation didn't make sense to me.</s>
<s>This is the first I have had to do, what is the procedure?</s>
<s>You are right, I apologize not doing so.</s>

<s>It shouldn't be that hard to find info, or images, but I already have them, so if I give you this stuff, perhaps could you do it?</s>
<s>I think a separate security section heading is required in <url> article as it gets prime billing in the introduction, but then has references (and criticisms) scattered throughout the rest of the article.</s>
<s>Do you support this?</s>

<s>How many Canadian articles are even at that status?</s>
<s>Maybe the bot needs to begin adding a source.</s>

<s>Hi Jean, just to ask your opinion.</s>
<s>Do you think <url> article is of a quality to maybe nominate it for GA yet?</s>
<s>That image is CC and has a link to its source.</s>

<s>Pat, for someone who has died, you don't say "he is a former professional baseball player", you say "he was a professional baseball player".</s>

<s>Hey MBK; well, I've got to be honest I wasn't expecting the events of last night - personally I thought the discussion was going reasonably well (not fabulously, but we were getting somewhere) and, whilst I agree that Mlm's actions weren't exactly advised, I must admit it does seem to be a relatively minor thing to retire over - was there something else going on here that made it the straw that broke his back?</s>

<s>Not a whole lot of contrast with the letters now, if you've traversed the link.</s>

<s>You added partisan colours for the early Chancellors (such as a conservative blue colour for Bismarck); as the early Chancellors were not attached to any political party, and the "party" given is merely an approximate indication of their political leanings, I'm not sure if this is a good idea.</s>

<s>I was wondering if any of the books you have can shed much more light on <url>?</s>
<s>These edits appear to be related to the same issue that caused the page to be protected.</s>
<s>Could you please explain why you are doing this?</s>
<s>So I take it you live in Perth?</s>
<s>Have you ever been to Virginia?</s>
<s>BTW, are you having a problem with the orange strip that tells you that you have a message?</s>
<s>Mine keeps on coming back when there is no message?</s>
<s>Indeed.</s>
<s>.</s>

<s>The trolls just keep coming.</s>
<s>Are you aware of content of the <url>?</s>
<s>Here, let me parse it out for you:''I regret that because Gravitor and Carfiend's behavior consists of acting in tandem (in the manner of meat or sock puppets), refuse to discuss disputed content on the talk page, and continally provoke revert wars that some administrative intervention is likely required.</s>
<s>'' Is it clear now?</s>
<s>David Sprenkle was at the University of Illinois in 1982 (at least part of it) while I was there.</s>
<s>Were you there too?</s>
<s>4.</s>

<s>What are you talking about?</s>
<s>I see on your user page you are claiming credit for creating '''The Cops''' article however wasn't it initally created by another user <url> on 26 January 2007 ?</s>

<s>Haha, hey guys.</s>
<s>Who is Temple alumni?</s>
<s>I thought that VAMOS section was dealing primarily with captions (perhaps a clearer wording is needed there?</s>
<s>).</s>
<s>Also, I have seen dates used as adjectives quite often - the "1848 Revolution", for example - where did you read about this rule?</s>
<s>Yep, no worries.</s>
<s>What's the article?</s>
<s>I don't understand what you are trying to ask me or suggest that I do.</s>

<s>Alright, thanks.</s>
<s>Where do I find these templates?</s>
<s>Indeed, the New York Times tells us that Iain Hook "''was shot in the back by an Israeli soldier ''".</s>
<s>Why did a member of the IDF shoot him?</s>
<s>Thanks for telling me.</s>
<s>Do you just perform the rename, and I then re-create the account to take it for myself?</s>
<s>How are recognizing and not recognising defined in this context?</s>
<s>The country has explicitly and officially stated that they do or do not recognise the State of Palestine?</s>
<s>I always thought it would be better to list both missions (up and down) but only include one patch (up) to clarify the fact that it is one mission altogether, this is how it's done in other articles about non-career astronauts and cosmonauts.</s>
<s>Is there a policy that says anything about this?</s>
<s>How about Guant who plays Pansy?</s>
<s>Or Richard Fish who played Bill Weasley, and the actor who played Charlie Weasley in POA?</s>
<s>When you say "thrown off" articles which tend to be in math, the sciences, IT, etc.</s>

<s>Why did you just blank your userpage?</s>
<s>It's not Wikisuicide, is it?</s>
<s>A redirect works exactly the same way regardless of whether there's a space between "#REDIRECT" and the target article's name or not.</s>
<s>Why bother removing spaces from the redirects if it doesn't change the functionality at all?</s>
<s>Thanks for improving the article.</s>
<s>Can you add categories also?</s>
<s>I have created a Neutral section for those who agree with the premise but not the method, or some other aspect, which may be altered following talkpage discussion.</s>
<s>Perhaps you would wish to review your !</s>

<s>I have it ready now.</s>
<s>Would there be any policy violations if I upload the image over the protected one?</s>
<s>I notice you are still contributing to Wikipedia, but have not responded to my argument.</s>
<s>Do you now agree with the argument I suggested?</s>
<s>Hi Dan.</s>
<s>Is the page <url> still needed/useful?</s>
<s>Hey, thanks for your contributions here :).</s>
<s>Would you mind referencing them to conform with wiki-policy?</s>
<s>It's alive!</s>
<s>Care to critique the reborn <url> article <G>?</s>
<s><url>.</s>
<s>I wonder if anyone will actually suspect a conflict of interest?</s>
<s>I removed the hyphen from "oldest-known", which is hard to see if you aren't looking for it.</s>
<s>Does that answer the question?</s>
<s>OK, maybe alcohol is depressing my injoke-comprehension circuits, but I can't fathom <url> edit summary at all.</s>
<s>Care to explain?</s>
<s>I noticed you put "NB" and then the credit for the original picture that I cropped.</s>
<s>What does "NB" stand for?</s>

<s>My page now has a template of "multiple issues", but I have put in several references, and there are links to other pages.</s>
<s>What more should I do?</s>
<s>Do you by any chance happen to have the old legs (such as in the figures shown <url>) that go with the old armless torso?</s>
<s>If so, would it be possible for you could take a picture of a minifig with that, the old torso and preferably a non-printed head?</s>
<s>Yes, I know what a score ''card'' is, but you wrote "score '''car'''" in the article.</s>
<s>Was that a typo, or is there really such a thing as a score "car"?</s>
<s>Sovereignty is something a thing, in this case Japan, possesses, hence the apostrophe.</s>
<s>So what's the problem?</s>
<s>Still highly POV.</s>
<s>Shall we put pictures of human skeletons from Auschwitz on <url>?</s>
<s>What do you think about the character section?</s>
<s>Think we should add a few more/take away Ona Nobis and Zan Arbor?</s>

<s>Now, one last thingu2014since the account 'Dalahxe4st' already exists on Swedish Wikipedia and doesn't appear to have been taken over automatically, where should I go to take care of that?</s>
<s>you recently deleted <url>.</s>
<s>can you tell me where is the AfD debate on that article?</s>
<s>Huh, I've never actually bothered to use Google Book search.</s>
<s>I'll e-mail you some stuff shortly, but here's another topic for thought: can we find any more stylistic characteristics for the genre aside from its association with underground art, its roots in punk and punk forms (hardcore and post-punk), and the fact that, judging by their lyrics, a lot of the artists seem to be miserable bastards (I love how the 1990 EW link makes a point of this)?</s>
<s>No problem.</s>
<s>:) Did you see the additional notes on the project talk page about the rest of those books from the 70s?</s>
<s>Hi, this will seem a little odd, but your name seems very familiar.</s>
<s>Did you ever play an online game named <url> by chance?</s>
<s>Why are you trying to delete my user page, literally less than a minute after I began it.</s>
<s>You are allowed one so why not me?</s>
<s>Wow, you have a lot of gall, given you removed the West Wing discussion from your Talk Page with the edit summary "Archiving crap".</s>
<s>Perhaps if your going to make unnecessary comments on people's talk pages, you should hold yourself to the same standard?</s>
<s>I responded to you on my talk page.</s>
<s>A pity the WorldCat proposals you posted met with such deafening silence.</s>
<s>.</s>
<s>.</s>
<s>but can we claim that as implicit support?</s>
<s>- millions of people are using it to get help our service is free of charge.</s>
<s>Since it's a tech support site you can't claim that it's not related to the article either (if you disagree with that just google for "consumer electronics tech support" see who comes first).</s>
<s>We are here to server the community - why do you find it so offensive?</s>
<s>To be honest (in my experience) those tags are quite likely to stay <u>forever</u> -  because people actually fixing things is a very rare event.</s>
<s>.</s>
<s>If you want to see a better article is might be quicker to just start cleaning up one .</s>
<s>.</s>
<s>maybe then others might take it as an example of good practice?</s>
<s>I am for some reason disappointed that it took me a few seconds longer to pick up the Bon Jovi reference than it did the Tom Petty one.</s>
<s>Does that mean the terrorists have already won?</s>
<s>Thankyou Fail, but the template I want is the one that goes at the bottom of the article and produces a message that goes something like 'This article is a copy of the (X) article in the German wikipedia, version 21 December 2009 10:04.</s>
<s>' What is that template?</s>
<s>Thanks for your reply.</s>
<s>You are, I take it, aware that you can be blocked for disruptive editing?</s>

<s>Anyway ok with you?</s>
<s>I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself.</s>
<s>Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around "naming" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?</s>
<s>I am a fairly new admin.</s>
<s>When is it appropriate to use such a block as you did with a user I'd blocked?</s>
