Classifier features:
- Bag-of-words
- Sentiment
- Annotaties
- Iets met treees


Data-analyis
- Maybe leave out sentences for which five very different ratings were given?
- Maybe try to detect "outturks" that misclassify politeness?
- Maybe normalize the score a Turk gives, such that all Turks give scores with the same mean and standard deviation?

Bag-of-words:
- Create dictionary d such that d[word] gives expected politeness of words, computed by taking all sentences containing the word and taking the mean score
- Maybe do the same for sequences of words instead of single words
- Maybe do the same for (word, position) pairs
- Maybe add POS tags
- Maybe use Data Oriented Parsing

Visualisation/testing:
- Train and evaluate classifier
- Give colors to word(sequences) based on learned Bag-of-Words model
- Give suggestions based on POS tag/syntactical compatibility and learned probabilities
